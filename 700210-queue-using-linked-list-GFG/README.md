# [Queue using Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implement-queue-using-linked-list/1)
## Easy
Implement a&nbsp;Queue&nbsp;using a Linked List, this queue has no fixed capacity and can grow dynamically until memory is available.The Queue must support the following operations:
(i)&nbsp;enqueue(x): Insert an element x at the rear of the queue.(ii)&nbsp;dequeue(): Remove the element from the front of the queue.(iii)&nbsp;getFront():&nbsp;Return front element if not empty, else -1.(iv)&nbsp;isEmpty():&nbsp;Return true if the queue is empty else return false.(v)&nbsp;size(): Return the number of elements currently in the queue.
There will be a sequence of queries&nbsp;queries[][]. The queries are represented in numeric form:

1 x : Call enqueue(x)
2: Call dequeue()
3: Call getFront()
4: Call isEmpty()
5: Call size()

You just have to implement the functions&nbsp;enqueue,&nbsp;dequeue,&nbsp;getFront,&nbsp; isEmpty&nbsp;and&nbsp;size. The driver code will handle the input and output.
Examples:
Input: q = 7, queries[][] = [[1, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [3], [2], [5], [4]]
Output: [5, 2, false]
Explanation: Queries on queue are as follows:enqueue(5): Insert 5 at the rear of the queue.enqueue(3): Insert 3 at the rear of the queue.enqueue(4): Insert 4 at the rear of the queue.getFront(): Return the front element i.e 5.dequeue(): Remove the front element 5 from the queue.size(): Queue now has 2 elements.isEmpty(): Queue is not empty return false.
Input: q = 4, queries[][] = [[4], [3], [1, 10], [5]]
Output: [true, -1, 1]
Explanation: Queries on queue are as follows:isEmpty(): Queue is empty return true.getFront(): Queue is empty return -1.enqueue(10): Insert 10 at the rear of the queue.size(): Queue contains 1 element return 1.
Constraints:1 ≤ number of query ≤ 1030 ≤ x&nbsp;≤ 105
