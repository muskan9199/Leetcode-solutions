# [Prefix to Infix Conversion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/prefix-to-infix-conversion/1)
## Medium
Given a string s representing a valid mathematical expression in prefix notation. The string consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters as operands, and the operators +, -, *, /, %, and ^.
Convert the given prefix expression into its equivalent fully parenthesized infix expression and return the resulting string.
Examples :
Input: s = "*-A/BC-/AKL"
Output: ((A-(B/C))*((A/K)-L))
Explanation: The prefix expression starts with '*', so the final operation is multiplication.The left subexpression '-A/BC' converts to '(A-(B/C))', and the right subexpression '-/AKL' converts to '((A/K)-L)'.
Combining these two subexpressions with '*' gives the fully parenthesized infix expression: ((A-(B/C))*((A/K)-L))

Input: s = "+A*BC"Output: (A+(B*C))Explanation: The prefix expression starts with '+', so the final operation is addition.
The left operand is 'A', and the right subexpression '*BC' converts to '(B*C)'.
Combining them with '+' gives the fully parenthesized infix expression: (A+(B*C))
